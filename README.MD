# Getting started

- Install errbot using `pip install errbot`
- create an errbot folder anywhere, and enter it
- Init the errbot installation with `errbot --init`
- Edit `config.py` and replace `CHANGE ME` by your name (any name will work for development) with a starting `@`
- Launch errbot using the `errbot` command
- Install this plugin with `!repos install https://github.com/USDevOps/err-geoloc` (Note that you need to hit enter two times after typing any command on development mode)
    - (Alternatively, you can just clone the repo inside `plugins/err-geoloc` to make it easier to work on it)
- Verify that the plugin was installed using `!status plugin`
